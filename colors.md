# Brand color investigation.

Expand our selection of @brand-colors.json to include popular technology topics that could appear as tags on GitHub repos. For example `aws`, `netlify`, `heroku`, and `react`. For each color that you find, add a listing to `colors.md` in a markdown table with the name, the color hex code, and the url to the source where you found the brand color so that I can verify after.

Two resources that could be useful:

- @https://www.brandcolorcode.com/
- @https://brandcolors.net/

Only choose the primary color for a brand if it has multiple.
