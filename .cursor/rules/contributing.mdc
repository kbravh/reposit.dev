Always run `npm run fix` after making changes.

Whenever you run tests, run `npm run test:run` so that vitest does not go into watch mode.

Styling should be done with Tailwind v4.

When making any new components or pages, always check `examples/` for example components and pages (from Tailwind Plus).
