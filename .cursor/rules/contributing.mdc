Always run `npm run fix` after making changes.

Whenever you run tests, run `npm run test:run` so that vitest does not go into watch mode.

Styling should be done with Tailwind v4.

When making any new components or pages, always check `examples/` for example components and pages (from Tailwind Plus). If the pattern does not exist there, check [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). Then, check [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

Icons should be from the `lucide-react` package, except for brand icons which come `@icons-pack/react-simple-icons`.
