# Reposit

Reposit is _the_ place to keep track of repositories. Find some interesting repositories you want to keep an eye on for future projects? Need to keep a handy list of all the repositories your team manages? Whatever your need may be, Reposit is the tool for it.

## MVP Planned features

- add a GitHub repository to your list by its url or its `org/name`
- add tags to repositories
- create lists of repositories
  - by tags (include and/or exclude)
  - add or exclude individually
- manage common tasks via keyboard shortcuts to support power users

## Future ideas

- Support repositories from BitBucket and other repository sites
